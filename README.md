# R-template
#### *This project is considered complete and should not see major updates*

This repository contains a template useful for starting new R analyses.
As a demonstration, a very simple analysis of microarray data is included.
To load neccessary packages, renv and Docker environments are provided as well as a Singularity wrapper.
Users are encouraged to scan through the files and comments, picking and choosing components relevant to their needs.
